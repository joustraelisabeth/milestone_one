## This is README about this mile-stone one project

### This site is for marketing DWU.   
The business idea is to meet the need of enjoying and discovering the wild life in the surroundings nearby and also the need of fellowship, especially now in the times of the pandemic.
### The owners goal:
Get new members to join and take part of different activities and to increase their services.
### The users goal:
Get information about what DWU can do for them, get inspiration from beautiful pictures in the wild and the possibility to sign up and also write some personal preferences.


## UX
The userexperience:
To meet the needs of both 2C2 and 2B2.
2C2 (Often impulsive and emotional actions) should get the possibility already on the first side with a Sign Up button in the middle of the page (Hero image)
2B2 (Often a group of people who want to know more an discuss before they take a decision) should get the possibility on the first page to go to the About side and read more before going to the Sign Up page.


## Features
The site har three pages; Index (Home) About  and Sign Up 
On every site a nav in the top to the right with a list with links to the different pages. They should be displayed with an active command so the user know where they are.
On every site a footer with  links to social media Face book and Instagram (With links from Font awesome) 
Index: A header with a background-image that covers the entire body and a square  with a short text and a sign Up botton with hover effect that takes them directly to the Sign Up page for group 2C2 (if they wish). The  square with a nice colour and with opacity (rgba)
About More information about the tree different activities. Three photos shown as a circle. With text under.
Sign Up A form with contains a form to fill in First name Last name and Email adress. A possibility to chose activity and to give more information. Every type with a label in front. 
It should also be a list with radiobuttons with labels. Three alternatives: 1. Guided tour in the wild 2. Learning how to make fire and cook in the wild 3. Games and felowship in the wild. There should also be a textarea beneath were they can add special information if they wish.  


**Features Left to Implement** 

1.    Adjust the page so it is responsive to different devices 
2.    To make a confirmation document or at least something that after they have pressed the submit button in the Sign Up Form?
3.    Three photos in circle boxes in the About side

## Media:
 The background-image is taken with my Iphone. 
## Credits: 
I took insipration for the four projects in the course: The Coders Coffehouse, Love Running, Whiskey Drop and Rosie Odenkirk. 
The Coders cofeehouse: The fixed footer
Love Running: The menu with links and the signup page
Whiskey Drop: The Sign Up button and the hover effects
Rosie Odenkirk: The textarea as a complement to the form
Where using w3schools most of the time to learn and remember things we have learnt. Did´t copy any code and tried to do it from the beginning to learn and repeat.
Sorry didn´t made it with responsive design. 
## Technological utilities: 
Have been observing the tab "Problems in Gitpod"
Have made commmitments to git; "initial", "index done", "signup done".
Have been using the devtools in Google to see how it was displayed in Iphone six.

## Technologies:
Made first wireframenr1 (attached here) Sent it to the mentor according to agreement.
Before our second chat decided to reduce it to wireframe2.

The background picture was made to landscape size and saved as acopy with low resolution in Photopad.

Background picture in a div as a wrapper. (Preparing for different photos on different pages )
Hade to solve the margins with -20px; (top) and -8px; (left). Was searching in W3schools for position and to get rid of the scrollbar.
Added overflow:hidden in the body and position:absolute; to the div.

The square in the middle: Used vh and vw so it should be more responsive to different devices.

The menu: In this had case had to look at the code in Love Running but remade the margins and the text-decoration for the displayed
pages after using w3schools.

The footer: Was learning in w3schools how to do it and also remembered from the lessons about font-awesome.

The about page: Used display:inlineblock and vw for the different divs. Tried with spans at first but it didnt work.

The Sign Up page: Took inspiration from Love Running Sign Up page but wrote the code with help from w3schools. 
was creating classes and did som styling.

Otherwise different things have been solved in threw styling different classnames.
Hope fully the css file can give some insight in that.

Thanks for your time to read this.
